Jake's todo list:
    maybe be able to switch between randomly choosing next question type vs. iterating over each question type enabled, then repeat.
        With the random system, it seems like "what movie is this" doesn't come up as often as I would like
    remove scoring stuff
    remove named user stuff
    maybe have new question that finds a random movie and grabs a single frame from that movie, and displays to the user.
    test on windows, linux, rpi-libreelec, android?
    restore integration with cinema experience? -yes, cinama experience is dead and its replacement (cinema vision) has no existing integration with moviequiz.
    set buggalo to my email?
    make it so exiting is faster (get rid of background animation at exit)
    add logger module for logging with level warning for testing, so I don't have to enable debug logging.
    remove timed question round and limited number of questions round.
    where is cinema vision getting their quotes, trivia from?
    the game.Game class has member: interactive. This is passed True from all places that instantiate it.
        (cinema experience integration used to possibly pass in False, but that integration is dead)
    have name the movie be full screen
    put length to play movie in settings
    put min, max percent of movie to start from in settings
    add settings shortcut to main menu screen
    change hard-coded numbers to string constants
